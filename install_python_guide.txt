Python Installation Guide for CSV Image Search Tool
=====================================================

PROBLEM: "Command not found" when running batch file
CAUSE: Python is not installed or not in PATH

SOLUTION STEPS:

1. Download Python
   - Go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - Download Python 3.8 or newer for Windows
   - Choose "Windows installer (64-bit)" for most computers

2. Install Python (IMPORTANT SETTINGS)
   ✅ CHECK "Add Python to PATH" (very important!)
   ✅ CHECK "Install for all users" (recommended)
   - Click "Install Now"
   - Wait for installation to complete

3. Verify Installation
   - Open NEW Command Prompt (Win+R, type "cmd", press Enter)
   - Type: python --version
   - Should show: Python 3.x.x
   - If still not working, try: py --version

4. If Python is installed but not in PATH:
   - Search "Environment Variables" in Windows Start menu
   - Click "Edit the system environment variables"
   - Click "Environment Variables..." button
   - In "System Variables", find and select "Path"
   - Click "Edit..."
   - Click "New" and add Python installation directory
     (usually: C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python3x\)
   - Click "New" again and add Scripts directory
     (usually: C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python3x\Scripts\)
   - Click OK on all dialogs
   - Close and reopen Command Prompt

5. Alternative: Use Python Launcher
   - If "python" doesn't work, try "py" instead
   - py --version
   - py -m pip install --upgrade pip

6. Test Installation
   - Open Command Prompt
   - Type: python -m tkinter
   - Should open a small test window
   - Close the window

7. Run the Build Script
   - Navigate to folder with Python files
   - Run: build_exe_simple.bat
   - Or run: check_environment.bat (for diagnosis)

TROUBLESHOOTING:

If you get "python is not recognized":
- Python is not installed OR
- Python is not in PATH OR
- You need to restart Command Prompt after installation

If you get permission errors:
- Run Command Prompt as Administrator
- Right-click Command Prompt icon
- Choose "Run as administrator"

If build fails:
- Check internet connection (needed for pip install)
- Try: py -m pip install pyinstaller aiohttp aiofiles chardet
- Then run build script again

ALTERNATIVE METHOD (if all else fails):
1. Install Anaconda instead of Python
   - Download from: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution
   - Includes Python and many packages pre-installed
2. Open "Anaconda Prompt" instead of Command Prompt
3. Run the build script from Anaconda Prompt
